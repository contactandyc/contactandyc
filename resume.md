## **About**

Engineering leader and inventor mentored to **assume nothing, keep it simple, and distrust “best practices.”** Practices what I call **“shelving knowledge”** — deliberately clearing the mind to stay fully present with the problem at hand. Began career by building and selling a **web-scale search engine** to Ask Jeeves, which became core to their platform. Track record includes inventing **near-duplicate detection**, pioneering **click-based relevance algorithms**, and even proposing improvements to foundational algorithms like **Quicksort**. These principles are core to **who I am, how I lead, and how I mentor others.**

## **Selected Impact**

* Built and sold **web-scale search engine at 21 (1999)** — independently derived inverted index, tries, cosine similarity.
* Created a **personalized TV/movie search system** using Facebook likes + metadata (Clicker, acquired by CBS).
* Developed method to **make Zillow’s Zestimate explainable in time and space**, leading to targeted ML improvements.
* Shipped **snippet generation and click algorithms at Ask Jeeves**, driving massive user growth.
* Led the **Last.fm turnaround** — rebuilt platform for \~10x annual cost savings while scaling to 50k RPS and making it chaos-tolerant.

## **Inventions**

* **Efficient near-duplicate detection (2001):** dual inverted indices + longest-sentence hashing; shingling-like accuracy with far lower cost.
* **Click-based/user behavior algorithms** for search & recommendations (Ask Jeeves).
* **Ad inventory system** reduced time to get inventory from many hours to a couple seconds (or less). 
* **Adaptive Quicksort early-out (2019):** novel improvement for sorted/partially sorted data.
